//When you add the player into a new scene and scale him up or down, THIS WILL BREAK THE CHARACTER CONTROLLER
//If you do scale him up you'll need to increase the Move Speed Variable and the Ground Distance variable
//Play around with the move speed until it feels right and increase the Ground Distance by .1 until the player jumps
//Set the startPos prefab at the begining of the lvl where you want the player to respwawn
//Set the playerReset prefab below the lvl to send the player back to the startPos
